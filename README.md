### Types of Projects
 - Hour to 24-Hour Conversion
 - Consonant Time Converter
 - Positive Integer Validator


## How the Programs Work

### Hour to 24-Hour Conversion
This project focuses on converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time and displaying it in the proper format. It contains functions specifically designed for this conversion.
### Consonant Time Converter
Similar to the Hour Clock project, Consonant Time Converter deals with converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time and displaying it. It includes dedicated functions for this task.
### Positive Integer Validator
This project checks if exactly two out of three provided integers are positive. It involves validation and conditional checking to determine the positivity of the integers.

## How to Use the Project
```
git clone git@github.com:Morgan-Ngetich/Phase-3-Week-1-Toy-Problems.git
```
```
cd Phase-3-Week-1-Toy-Problems
```
****Open the files in your text editor***
1. **Hour to 24-Hour Conversion**: Enter the hour, minute, and period ('am' or 'pm') when prompted to convert 12-hour time to 24-hour time.
2. **Consonant Time Converter**: Similar to the Hour to 24-Hour Conversion, follow the prompts to convert time from 12-hour to 24-hour format.
3. **Positive Integer Validator**: Input three integers, and the program will determine if exactly two of them are positive.

## Features
- Conversion of 12-hour time to 24-hour time format
- Validation of user inputs
- Identification of exactly two positive integers out of three provided numbers

## Built With
- Python
